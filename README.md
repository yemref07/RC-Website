# RC Website
https://panel.rapp.com.tr/s/

This website has been specifically developed for Randevu Centre users, offering customizable design options through the Appointment Center panel, allowing the hiding of specific sections.

Key sections like working hours, about us, popular services, and services can be modified using the Appointment Centre panel. Additionally, the business can opt for one of two appointment booking methods: 'quick appointment' or 'confirmed appointment.' Certain sections of the site will adapt based on the chosen method.

The 'confirmed appointment' method allows users to select an appointment from available dates and times, confirming it via an SMS sent to their phone. Users can print or save appointment details as a PDF.

Contrarily, the 'Make an Appointment Fast' option allows users to request an appointment directly, requiring the business to subsequently contact the user for necessary information.
